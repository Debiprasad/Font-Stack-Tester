Font Stack Tester
=================

Currently it's a useless and messy demo in JavaScript, but eventually I want to 
turn this into a handy bookmarklet.

Basically, on loading it scans through all the font-family CSS elements to get a
list of all the fonts used on the page. Next it generates a 'remove' button for
each unique font.

The idea is you could test what a web site looks like when the user doesn't have
a particular font installed, hence the name 'Font Stack Tester'.

Any comment and assistance gratefully received :)
